#### Notes:  
- An ERC20 token is a standard used for creating and issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.  
- Smart contracts can be used to create smart property or tokenized assets that people can invest in. 
- ERC stands for "Ethereum request for comment"   
- Uniswap is a protocol on Ethereum for swapping ERC20 tokens. 
- Unlike most exchanges, which are designed to take fees, Uniswap is designed to function as a public friendly tool 
- It is made for the community to trade tokens without platform fees or middlemen.
